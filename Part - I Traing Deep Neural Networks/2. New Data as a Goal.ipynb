    "# Creating a model that is effective with *new data*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of big data, we create ~2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. Free datasets are available from places like [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html). Crowdsourced datasets are built through creative approaches - e.g. Facebook asking users to \"tag\" friends in their photos to create labeled facial recognition datasets. More complex datasets are generated manually by experts - e.g. asking radiologists to label specific parts of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until this point we have been working with a *very small* dataset of 16 images. We really need 10s of thousands of labeled images and don't (yet) have that for Louie. Luckily, Kaggle has a dataset that we can start with consisting of 18750 labeled images of dogs and cats. Instead of teaching our network who Louie is, let's start by teaching it what a dog is.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this task, you will have a trained neural network that can correctly classify dogs and cats that were not part of the training dataset.\n",

(This is a core tenant of deep learning which will not be fully described here, as an understanding of the math *that the computer is doing* should not be a barrier to solving problems with deep learning, but for those who would like to learn more, save [this video from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) to watch later.) ![](images/propogation.png) \n",

Validation data is fed through the network to generate an output, but the network *does not learn anything* from the data. Loss is reported but the model itself is unchanged! We can use the same validation dataset to assess our performance on new data over and over again while continuing to treat it like *new* data. ![](images/forwardprop.png)  \n",
