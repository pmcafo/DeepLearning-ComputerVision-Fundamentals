    "# Creating a model that is effective with *new data*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of big data, we create ~2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. Free datasets are available from places like [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html). Crowdsourced datasets are built through creative approaches - e.g. Facebook asking users to \"tag\" friends in their photos to create labeled facial recognition datasets. More complex datasets are generated manually by experts - e.g. asking radiologists to label specific parts of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until this point we have been working with a *very small* dataset of 16 images. We really need 10s of thousands of labeled images and don't (yet) have that for Louie. Luckily, Kaggle has a dataset that we can start with consisting of 18750 labeled images of dogs and cats. Instead of teaching our network who Louie is, let's start by teaching it what a dog is.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this task, you will have a trained neural network that can correctly classify dogs and cats that were not part of the training dataset.\n",
